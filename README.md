This webpage can be hosted on local server by using VS Code Editor live server. So for running the website on local server we have to download these files and images, and open it in VS Code Editor in a folder. While the index.html file is opened there will be a port option in the bottom right corner of the VS Code Editor window. Clicking on it might pop up some message that we will click 'OK' then that button will turn to 'Go Live'. Clicking on it will take us to the web page. Please make sure all these files and images should be in the same folder.
